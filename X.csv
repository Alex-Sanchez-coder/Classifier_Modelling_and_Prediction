"happpy amazng In 1992 we |, || , ,%,&,/,(,),=,?,*,+,^,-,...,<,> bought a new ! .,:,{,},[,],Taurus !+ !, |and we really loved it  So in 1999 we decided to try a new Taurus  I did not care for the style of the newer version  but bought it anyway I do not like the new car half as much as i liked our other one  Thee dash is much to deep and takes up a lot of room  I do not find the seats as comfortable and the way the sides stick out further than the strip that should protect your card from denting It drives nice and has good pick up  But you can not see the hood at all from the driver seat and judging and parking is difficult  It has a very small gas tank I would not buy a Taurus if I had it to do over  I would rather have my 1992 back  I dont think the style is as nice as the the 1992  and it was a mistake to change the style  In less than a month we had a dead battery and a flat tire "
 The last business trip  I drove to San Francisco  I went to Hertz Rentals and got a 1999 Ford Taurus  thinking it looked comfortable and professional  I found the seating to be uncomfortable for myself  as well as for my passenger Now  seating comfort may not be important to you  but it is to me The fuel usage was fine  the car did get us there with no problems  but  it was such an uncomfortable ride for both of us  It is not as though I am hard to fit into a car  I am 5 5  weigh 115 pounds  and I am usually quite comfortable in most any car  But  the Taurus seemed especially uncomfortable  For anyone who is thinking of renting a car for a long trip  I would suggest that the Ford Taurus  1999  not be on the list of  be sure to get this There was a large trunk that allowed us to pack a lot of materials needed for the business end of the trip  Driving it was a breeze  and everything  worked  right  I have no complaints about the standard making of the car  except in the comfort area  How important is comfort to you  On a long trip  being an uncomfortable driver is distracting to me  and it made the trip seem unnecessarily longer than it should have felt  I make this trip a lot  The Saturn would have been a better choice for me  as I have rented this model quite often  It offers comforts that the Taurus simply does not have If you are planning a long trip  or to buy a car that you intend to be comfortably seated in  check out the Taurus on a longer trial basis than you might another car  You may find the same thing happening to your comfort
